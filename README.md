## 🔒 Authentication Flow (NFC + Firebase)

1. User taps their *NFC card*.  
2. ESP32 reads the *UID* and verifies it in *Firebase*.  
3. Access granted only if UID is registered.  
4. STM32 unlocks or ejects the corresponding slot.  
5. Unauthorized attempts are logged to Firebase.

## 🧠 AI-Based Battery Health Prediction

An *on-device TensorFlow Lite model* on ESP32 predicts the *health status* of each battery pack by analyzing:
- Voltage & current patterns  
- Temperature variations  
- Charge/discharge cycles  

*Prediction Output:*
| Status | Meaning |
|--------|----------|
| 🟢 Good | Battery performing optimally |
| 🟡 Degraded | Reduced efficiency detected |
| 🔴 Critical | Needs maintenance or replacement |

This AI-powered insight helps reduce downtime and improve reliability.
